# LangFlow Streaming Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented streaming responses for LangFlow integration with the following components:

## 1. New Streaming API Endpoint
- **File**: `src/ui/app/api/chat/stream/route.ts`
- **Purpose**: Handles streaming chat requests using Server-Sent Events (SSE)
- **Features**:
  - Uses LangFlow client's `chatStream()` method
  - Streams responses as they're generated
  - Maintains same initialization and context handling as regular chat
  - Proper error handling for streaming failures

## 2. Updated Chat Bubble Component
- **File**: `src/ui/components/chat-bubble.tsx`
- **Changes**:
  - Modified `handleSend()` to use streaming endpoint
  - Real-time message updates as tokens arrive
  - Visual streaming indicators (cursor animation)
  - Maintains thinking block processing for complete responses
  - Proper error handling for streaming failures

## 3. Enhanced User Experience
- **Real-time Response**: Messages appear token-by-token as they're generated
- **Visual Feedback**: 
  - "Streaming response..." indicator during loading
  - Animated cursor at end of streaming text
  - Existing thinking block functionality preserved
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback for streaming failures

## 4. Technical Implementation
- **Protocol**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) with `text/event-stream`
- **Format**: JSON data wrapped in SSE format (`data: {...}`)
- **Streaming Flow**:
  1. Client sends request to `/api/chat/stream`
  2. Server creates ReadableStream
  3. LangFlow client streams tokens via async generator
  4. Each token sent as SSE event
  5. Client updates UI in real-time
  6. Stream ends with `{done: true}` signal

## 5. Existing Features Preserved
- Model selection
- Session management
- Thinking blocks
- Message history
- Error handling
- Context initialization

## Usage
The streaming is now automatically enabled. When users send messages in the chat interface, they'll see responses appear in real-time as they're generated by LangFlow.

## Requirements
- LangFlow server must be running
- `USE_LANGFLOW=true` environment variable
- LangFlow client's `chatStream()` method must be supported by your LangFlow server

# React Component Documentation UI

A modern, interactive UI for displaying documentation of React components, built with Next.js and Shadcn/UI.

## Features

- 🔍 Search components by name
- 📝 Explore component methods
- 🧩 View component source code
- 🔄 Detect and display similar functions
- 🌙 Dark/light mode
- 💬 AI Chat integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17.0 or higher
- npm or pnpm

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
```

### Running the UI

This UI is designed to work with documentation generated by the recursive-react-docs-ai tool. The easiest way to run it is using the provided script:

```bash
# Run in development mode
./scripts/run-docs-ui.sh

# Run in production mode
./scripts/run-docs-ui.sh build
```

This script will:

1. Process documentation data from the generated docs
2. Build the Next.js application (in production mode) or start the development server
3. Serve the documentation UI

### Configuration

By default, the script looks for documentation in `../../docs`. You can customize this by setting the `DOCS_PATH` environment variable:

```bash
DOCS_PATH=/path/to/docs ./scripts/run-docs-ui.sh
```

## Structure

- `app/` - Next.js app router pages and layout
- `components/` - UI components for the documentation
- `lib/` - Utility functions and data handlers
- `scripts/` - Helper scripts for processing docs data
- `public/` - Static assets and processed docs data

## Manual Setup

If you prefer to run the steps manually:

1. Process the documentation data:

   ```bash
   npm run process-docs
   ```

2. Start the development server:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Or build and run for production:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   npm run start
   ```

## Customization

You can customize the UI by modifying the following files:

- `app/layout.tsx` - Main layout and theme configuration
- `components/docs-sidebar.tsx` - Sidebar navigation
- `app/page.tsx` - Home page layout
- `tailwind.config.ts` - Theme colors and styling

## Integration with Documentation Generator

This UI is designed to work with the documentation generated by recursive-react-docs-ai. The generator outputs:

- `data.js` - Contains all component data
- `config.js` - Contains configuration for the documentation

The UI reads these files and displays the documentation in a user-friendly interface.
